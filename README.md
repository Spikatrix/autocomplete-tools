# Fig Autocomplete-Tooling Repo


This repo contains the source for all of Fig's publicly available NPM packages.

1. You can see the list of Fig's packages on the NPM registry here: https://www.npmjs.com/~withfig

2. You can see the source code and related readme for each package in the `./packages` folder


This repo currently uses [lerna](https://lerna.js.org/) for working with multiple packages.
